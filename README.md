# 🌟 Welcome to My Agentic AI Journey 🚀

Welcome to the world of **Agentic AI**, where the power of **LangChain** and **Google Gemini** come together to create intelligent, context-aware systems. This repository documents my personal journey in building and experimenting with **Agentic AI**, from initial experiments to advanced applications.

## 🔎 Explore the Projects

This journey is divided into two main sections:

### 1. **00 - Quick Start**
An introduction to **Google Gemini** and **Google Generative AI**. Here, you’ll see how I got started with basic AI tasks, fine-tuned parameters like **temperature** (set to **1.5** for extra creativity!), and learned to integrate **image generation** into prompts.

### 2. **01 - LangChain**
This section is all about building **contextual, dynamic AI applications** with **LangChain**. I dive into **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with **Pinecone** and combine multiple components to create intelligent workflows.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- **00 - Quick Start**: Start here if you're new to AI! Get your hands on the basics, from simple responses to advanced creativity.
- **01 - LangChain**: Once you're comfortable with the basics, move on to LangChain and explore how to build scalable, intelligent applications.
  
Each folder contains clear code examples, step-by-step instructions, and practical use cases that follow my evolving journey in Agentic AI.
