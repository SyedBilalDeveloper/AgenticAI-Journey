# 🌟 01 - LangChain: Building Dynamic AI Applications with Flair 🛠️

Welcome to the world of **LangChain**! In this folder, I take my **Agentic AI** journey to the next level by creating dynamic applications that adapt to context, integrate external data, and make intelligent decisions. With **LangChain**, I can combine powerful tools and models into seamless workflows.

## 🚀 Projects in This Folder

- **00_Hello_World_With_Gemini.ipynb**  
  Start your journey with **LangChain** by integrating **Google Gemini** into your first LangChain project. Let's make the **AI more intelligent** with structured and dynamic responses.

- **01_RAG_with_Pinecone_API.ipynb**  
  Dive into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** by connecting **LangChain** with **Pinecone**. This notebook shows how to **retrieve relevant information** and use it to enhance the AI’s responses.

---

## 🌱 Prerequisites

To follow along:
- **LangChain** and **Pinecone** libraries
- **Google API Keys** for Gemini and Pinecone
- **Python 3.8+**
